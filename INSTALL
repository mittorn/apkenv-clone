To compile apkenv:

% make [PLATFORM={platform}] [SOFTFP=1]

Default platform is sdl, possible is maemo, pandora, x11, sdl, eglnative
Default target is hardfloat, you need to specify SOFTFP=1 to disable hardfp-targeted assertions.

And to install it:

# make [PREFIX={prefix}] BIONIC_LIBS_PATH={/path/to/libs/} install

BIONIC_LIBS_PATH is a path, where from to copy android libc.so,libm.so, libstdc++.so.
You can place it to ${PREFIX}/lib/apkenv/bionic manually.
You can get it from https://github.com/mittorn/apkenv-libs by git or copy them from working android build.
